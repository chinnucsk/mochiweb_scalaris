This is a simple example of how to provide an HTTP api to Scalaris via Mochiweb.

(note: this code originally lived on Google Code. Moved to github)

Requirements:
 - Scalaris (http://code.google.com/p/scalaris/)
 - Mochiweb (http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/)
 - Erlang R12.x

Build:
 - Make a softlink to the MochiWeb ebin files in the deps directory
 - run "make" in this directory

Setup:
 1. Start Scalaris on your machine. See the README file in the Scalaris source.
 2. In the "start-dev.sh" script set the BOOT_NODE variable to the name of the Scalaris boot node ("boot@localhost")
 3. If you changed the -setcookie value on Scalaris, set it to the new value in "start-dev.sh"

Start it up!
 - run "./start-dev.sh" in another terminal

How it works:
  - To store a Key:Value on Scalaris: Send a post (or get) to: 
     "http://localhost:8002/scalaris/write" with the parameters: key="your key", value="the value"
  - To read a value from Scalaris: Send a get to:
      "http://localhost:8002/scalaris/read" with the parameters: key="your key"
